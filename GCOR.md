## GCOR Rule 6.19 D (paraphrased)

> When a train stops on a main track, flag protection must be provided


On a layout, torpedoes and fusees are a bit over the top, but a
brakeman/flagman with a red lantern can add a twist to your next operating
session.  Adopt prototype practices and have your crews protect
their trains when switching a town or otherwise fouling the main.
Just don't forget to recall the flagman before leaving town!


## Designed in the NMRA/PCR for DCC layouts

Assembly required
 
1. V1.0-1.3: Use a track nipper to detach the base from the hand holding the LED.
1. V2.x: Snap the base from the feet and remove any extra PCB frame from around the figure.
1. Solder the two feet to the two small gold pads on the top of the base
1. You can solder a wire (the clipped off resistor leads work well) to strengthen and align this connection
1. Attach the weight to the top of the base next to (but not touching) his feet with double sided foam tape
1. Place the large gold pads across the rails to light the red lantern.

Variation:
  * Make a "Safety Sam" to indicate track or rolling stock that must not be used/moved.  Use 2 BLUE LEDs instead of one RED one - solder them "back to back, opposite" so that one LED's long lead is soldered to the "front" on the raised hand, while the other's long lead is soldered to the figure's "back" on the lowered hand.  Using 2x Blue LEDS is necessary because the Blue LED's have a reverse breakdown voltage close to 5v, while the common Red ones seem to be able to handle 20v+.  (DCC track voltage is ~15v...)

Clean track works best.  Use violates UP Safety Rule 81.2.1, Step Over Rail
