An electronic DCC-track-driven figurine with a red or blue LED

V2.0 is effectively the same as v1.3, but it has better documentation
in the gerber files for panelization and adds a couple of traces
between the base and the figure to allow full panel prebuilds and
easy testing - the 2 traces are intended to be cut during the final
assembly process.

This version adds back the vias on the feet to allow for adding
support wires to reinforce the solder joint that is prone to snapping
off when Brakie is taken out of service and stuck in a pocket - and
then sat upon...

Finally, the figure is now wearing a belt :-)
