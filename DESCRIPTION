An electronic DCC-track-driven figurine with a red or blue LED

Designed for fabrication and ease of assembly

For best results when fabing, choose
  * ENIG (gold) rather than a Hot Air Solder Layer (HASL) for the pads (gold doesn't tarnish like tinned pads) 
  * White or Blue soldermask, Black silkscreen
  * Panalize = user defined, one design (v2.5), 2 designs (prior versions)
  * FR4, 2-layer, 1.6, the other defaults are all OK
