An electronic DCC-track-driven figurine with a red or blue LED

v2.5 supports full SMT fabrication, with a single color on both arms.
Previous versions alloed hand assembly and used leaded-LEDs, which let the user choose between blue or red and hand location.

For best results when fabing, choose
  * ENIG (gold) rather than a Hot Air Solder Layer (HASL) for the pads (gold doesn't tarnish like tinned pads) 
  * White or Blue soldermask, Black silkscreen
  * Panalize = user defined, one design (v2.5), 2 designs (prior versions)
  * FR4, 2-layer, 1.6, the other defaults are all OK
